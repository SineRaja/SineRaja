## Introduction:
I am Sine Raja, a computer science student pursuing my master's degree in advanced computer science at the University of Leicester, United Kingdom. My academic and professional journey has been filled with challenges, opportunities, and growth, which has shaped me into the person I am today.

## Education:
I completed my bachelor's degree in GMRIT, India, and my schooling at Kendriya Vidyalaya. Throughout my education, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and technologies, including C, Java, Python, React JS, Angular JS, MongoDB, and MySQL. I am constantly seeking new learning opportunities and have completed various online courses, including the CCBP Intensive 4.0 Tech Program and the Accenture Digital Skills program.

## Work Experience:
I have 18 months of work experience in Accenture as an Associate Software Engineer, and also worked as a Full Stack Developer in SHA Associate, a start-up company. Through my work experience, I have gained extensive knowledge in front-end development and mobile app development, and have completed several projects, including a mobile app for crop disease recognition, a safety app for women, a hospital feedback app, a Netflix and food website, and a performance analysis framework for tumour prediction using decision tree and random forest algorithms.

## Volunteer Work:
In addition to my work experience, I have also been actively involved in volunteer work. I served as a member and head of the Web and Multimedia department at the GMRIT ACM Student Chapter, and secured first prize in the Mobile App Innovation Challenge conducted by OPEN Community and UPES in association with the Linux Foundation.

## Conclusion:
I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my technical skills, work experience, and passion for software development to your company. I believe that I can make a valuable contribution to your team and I look forward to discussing further how I can be of assistance. My family has always been a source of inspiration and motivation for me, especially my mother, who has been a constant source of support throughout my journey. I am grateful for all the opportunities and growth I have experienced and I am eager to continue learning and making a positive impact in the field of computer science.
